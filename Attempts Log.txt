Why I'm trying it/what possible cause am I trying to address?:


******************************


Random

gdb commands:
-info threads (shows what threads are running)
-thread [n] (switch to thread n)
-watch [variable] [condition] (after condition is met, the debugger pauses execution — keep in mind that the numbers you put in a condition are interpreted as hexadecimal)
-thread apply all backtrace (shows where all the threads are)
-thread apply all [command]

set breakpoints at relevant spots


Perhaps there’s some other shared data / some other race condition in my code that I have not accounted for.
